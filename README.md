# nhlthemes
nhlthemes enables R Studio users to quickly switch between the NHL team colored theme of their preference through the [R Studio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) functionality. This package currenlty only works on MAC. Place the NHL_Light_rstheme file in the ~/.R/rstudio/themes folder on your MAC.
